# 🐞 BugLens

**BugLens** is an intelligent assistant that helps teams spot, understand, and prioritize issues faster.  
Instead of just listing bugs, BugLens gives you *insight* — helping you see what really matters and why it’s happening.

---

## 💡 What It Does

- Automatically identifies and groups related bugs  
- Highlights recurring issues across different parts of your system  
- Prioritizes bugs based on severity, frequency, and impact  
- Generates clear, human-friendly explanations of each issue  
- Summarizes the overall health of your product or project  

With BugLens, debugging becomes a guided process instead of a guessing game.

## 🎯 Why It’s Useful

- Saves hours of manual triage and investigation  
- Keeps developers focused on what actually needs fixing  
- Helps teams communicate issues clearly without technical noise  
- Offers instant overviews for PMs, QA testers, and engineers alike  

Whether you’re maintaining a large platform or refining an early-stage product, BugLens helps you move from **“What’s broken?”** to **“Here’s what to fix next.”**

## 🚀 How to Use

1. **Run an analysis** on your latest error logs, test results, or feedback reports.  
2. **View summarized insights** — grouped by issue type, severity, or frequency.  
3. **Read AI-generated explanations** to understand the root cause in plain English.  
4. **Act on prioritized recommendations** to fix what matters most first.  

It’s that simple — no setup headaches, no complex dashboards. Just clear visibility into your bugs.
